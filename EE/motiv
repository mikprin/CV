The aim of this letter is to describe my major reasons and interests to join your project. I stumbled on your vacancy  in a field of EE. I think the product which your company offers is a kind of laptop I would buy for myself. It makes me proud if there will be a chance to work with you. Furthermore, I would be happy to join you in your intensive research and work with a full dedication.
